# Hi, I'm Kenny ðŸ‘‹

I love learning and experimenting with technology across the entire stack (from
making schematics and laying out PCBs to writing firmware or software to 
deploying containers in the cloud).

My other interests riding my bicycle or my motorcycle, playing video games, and
hanging out with my cat!
